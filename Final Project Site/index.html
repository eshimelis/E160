<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Kalman Filter (KF) is a filtering and prediction technique for 
    continuous systems; however, it is only limited to linear Gaussian 
    systems. In order for the Kalman filter to be correct, its derivation 
    relies on linear transformations. One method of applying this filter to 
    nonlinear systems is to instead use a first-order Taylor series estimate. 
    In a previous lab, we implemented a particle filter, which can be used to 
    approximate most distributions with enough particles; however, particle 
    filters are computationally expensive. The benefit of the Kalman filter 
    is its closed form solution, making a very fast technique for Gaussian systems
    The unscented Kalman filter (also known as sigma-point belief propagation) 
    is another method of linearizing nonlinear systems, for use in Kalman filtering. 
    Instead of linearizing a system, like the EKF, the UKF propogates sigma points 
    through the non-linear transformation. Sigma points are located at the mean and 
    symmetrically along the main axes of the covariance.

<h2>Project Definition</h2>
Localize a differential drive robot in a known map, using an algorithm more 
accurate than an extended Kalman filter and more efficient than a particle filter.
